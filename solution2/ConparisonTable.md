Conparison Table (me discussing it with gemini)

ControlledForm
code styles     declarative, useState
validation      realtime, each change trackable
reset           easy, using setter function to reset
readability     high, form logic in states
complexity      high for many fields, low for overall state
Pros            the react way: "single source of truth", ideal for complex forms
Cons            boilerplate, for each field: useState and onChange 

UncontrolledFormWithRef
code styles     imparative, uses useRef to access the DOM element for submission
validation      on form submission (after ref access)
reset           using useRef to set the value or call form.reset()
readability     moderate: Mixng React with DOM manipulation 
complexity      low for basic forms, medium if many fields need individual ref
Pros            less boilerplate in simple forms (no useState/onChange for update)
Cons            less react way, uses useRef for each field, state is not immediate

UncontrolledFormNoRef
code styles     imperative, using native FormData API
validation      on form submission, after formData collection
reset           form.reset()
readability     moderate, relying on FormData, more unfamiliar for react development
complexity      lowest for data collection, complexity for adv. logic (conditions)
Pros            simplest code: no state, no refs, using native browser API
Cons            Limited to field values on submit, not easily handling customs comp.
