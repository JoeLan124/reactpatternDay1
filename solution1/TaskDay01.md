# Day 01 - Your Tasks

Create a `ProductListContainer` that handles:

- API calls and data fetching
- Cart management
- Error handling

Create a `ProductListPresenter` that handles:

- Rendering products
- Sort/filter UI interactions
- Add to cart button clicks

Break down into smaller presenters:

- ProductCard
- SortFilterControls
- CartSummary

## Success Criteria

- Container has no JSX rendering logic
- Presenter has no API calls or business logic
- Components are reusable and testable
- Clear separation of concerns
